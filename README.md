# MsPacBot, a test in Genetic Algorithm hyperparameters and the effect they have on learning.

This is the repo for PacBot. PacBot is a system of training agents to play the game 
["Ms. PacMan"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ms._Pac-Man), released for the Atari 2600 in 1982. The game is interfaced

## Installation
To install, either call `pip install .` or `pip install -r requirements.txt`

To install dev dependencies (for running tests), call `pip install -e ".[dev]"`, or `pip install -r requirements.txt dev-requirements.txt`

## TODOs
* Train for longer
* Play around with different types of functions in genetic algos
